== Purpose

I am dissatisfied with a lot of music players. Those that exist
run either on Linux or Windows. Those that run on both are unstable
or do not comfort my requirements for a small, fast, decent player.

I do not need visualizations nor skins nor a lot of the other fancy
stuff out there. It shall play MP3 and maybe OGG thats it, and
that is what you shall find here.
